      In a colorful town called Rightsville, there lived a young boy named
      Benny. Benny was known for his kindness and his deep sense of
      responsibility. He had a special job in the town-he was the Guardian of
      Rightsville. One sunny morning, Benny was playing with his friends in the
      park when he noticed something strange. A group of older kids were teasing
      a smaller boy, Timmy. They were taking away his toys and being unkind.
      <br /><br /><br />
      Benny knew that everyone in Rightsville had the right to be protected from
      harm and bullying. So, he decided to act. He walked over to the older kids
      and said firmly, "Stop! Timmy has the right to be safe and happy, just
      like all of us." The older kids were surprised by Benny's confidence. They
      stopped teasing Timmy and realized that Benny was right. Timmy thanked
      Benny with a big smile, and they became friends.

      <br /><br /><br />
      Benny's actions made the town of Rightsville even more special. Children
      knew that they had the right to be protected from harm, just like Timmy
      did. Benny became a hero in their eyes, the Guardian of Rightsville, who
      stood up for what was right. From that day forward, Benny and his friends
      made sure that everyone in Rightsville felt safe and protected. They knew
      that their rights were precious, and they would do whatever it took to
      defend them. And so, the story of Benny, the Brave Guardian of
      Rightsville, taught children that they have the right to be protected from
      harm and that it's important to stand up for those rights, just like Benny
      did for Timmy.
